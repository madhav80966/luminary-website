        <!-- original 5 cards -->
        <div class="testimonial-card"><p>“I was so tired and frustrated after getting rejected again and again, even though I had the skills. Then one of my seniors told me about Luminary. They started applying to 2500+ jobs per month on my behalf, and within just 10 days, I started getting interview calls. In 1.5 months, I had 3 offers in hand! Their dedication and personal support made me feel like I’m not alone in this journey.”</p><h4>- Sai Krishna A, Data Engineer</h4></div>
        <div class="testimonial-card"><p>“I had no idea how to present myself professionally. My resume and LinkedIn were very basic. Luminary completely transformed my profile, gave me confidence, and the best part—they actually care. It’s not like other random services. They followed up daily and helped me with interview prep also. I never felt this supported before!”</p><h4>- Ritika S, Business Analyst</h4></div>
        <div class="testimonial-card"><p>“As an international student, it was hard to get responses. But Luminary really understood my situation. They applied non-stop, customized my resume for each job, and within 3 weeks I got shortlisted by 8 companies. I was shocked, honestly. I didn’t even know such a service existed. Full paisa vasool!”</p><h4>- Swetha R, Data Scientist</h4></div>
        <div class="testimonial-card"><p>“I used to apply on my own and hardly got any replies. After joining Luminary, they took complete ownership of my job search. Within one month, I had back-to-back interviews. What I loved most was their honesty, follow-ups, and the way they motivated me when I was feeling low. For me, it felt like having a big brother guiding you throughout.”</p><h4>- Swasthika M, Data Engineer</h4></div>
        <div class="testimonial-card"><p>“I honestly thought I’ll have to go back to India. No matter how many jobs I applied myself, I was not even getting callbacks. Then a friend forwarded Luminary’s link. After joining, they started applying to 2500+ jobs every month—I didn’t even know it was possible! In just 2 weeks, I started getting interviews. Within 35 days, I got an offer. I still can’t believe it. Lifetime grateful to Luminary!”</p><h4>- Anusha P, Jr Data Analyst</h4></div>
        <div class="testimonial-card"><p>“I used to sit for 6-7 hours daily applying to jobs manually and still no results. After joining Luminary, they applied to 2500+ jobs monthly without me doing anything. I just focused on upskilling and preparing for interviews. I got 4 interview calls in the first 10 days and landed my dream job in 1.5 months. No fake promises, only results. Truly next level support!”</p><h4>- Murali Mohan, Gen AI Model Tester, Citi</h4></div>
